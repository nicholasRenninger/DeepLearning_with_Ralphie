# Task

Matrix multiplication [1] is a fundamental linear algebraic operation, working knowledge of which is a prerequisite to understanding modern neural networks. In this assignment, you will implement matrix multiplication in pure Python (`python_matmul`) and in Python using NumPy (`numpy_matmul`). Skeletal versions of the two functions are provided in the included Python source file.

This assignment is an opportunity for you to assess your preparedness for the course. It does not count towards your final grade.

# Prerequisites

* Install Python 3.7 via Miniconda [2]
  * https://conda.io/miniconda.html
* Create a Python 3.7 environment
  * https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
* Activate the environment (depending on conda version)
  * `source activate ENVNAME` or `activate ENVNAME`
* Install NumPy and Jupyter: `conda install numpy jupyter`
* Run notebook
  * `jupyter notebook self-assessment.ipynb'
