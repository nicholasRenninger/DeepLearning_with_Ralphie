The net will have a single input unit and a single output unit, and a fully-connected layer of H hidden units. The inputs and target outputs are binary. When an input sequence is presented, the output state at the end of the sequence should be a parity bit: output should be 1 if the input has an odd number of '1' values. For example, the sequence 1-0-0-1-0-1 should yield output 1 and the sequence 0-0-0-0-1-1 should yield output 0. Note that a target is given only at the end of each sequence. (Parity is easy to learn if there is a target at each step that indicates parity given the sequence so far.)\n","\n","Parity is a hard problem for neural nets to learn because very similar inputs produce different outputs, and very dissimilar inputs can produce the same output.\n","\n","The aspects of the task we will manipulate are:  H, the number of hidden units, N, the length of the input strings, and the activation function for the hidden units, either tanh or LSTM-style neurons. The output neuron should have a logistic activation function.\n","\n","Tip: get started early.  Depending on your system, these nets can take several minutes to train.  Exploring hyperparameters (such as training rate) will be critical for success.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"kKEl35tibl8t"},"source":["### Some Help\n","Below are some helper codes to:\n","- generate input strings and their parity.\n","- provide a callback to trigger early stopping during training\n","- plotting"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"Rsf2q8L6UY8n","colab":{}},"source":["%tensorflow_version 2.x\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","from matplotlib import pyplot\n","\n","\n","def gen_binary_sequences(num, length):\n","  '''\n","  Generate :num: sequences of length :length:.\n","  '''\n","  return(np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num, length), dtype=np.int32))\n","\n","def calc_parity(seqs):\n","  '''\n","  Calculate sequence parity (1 if odd number of 1s, 0 if even number of 1s)\n","  '''\n","  return(seqs.sum(axis=-1) % 2)\n","\n","\n","class create_accuracy_callback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):\n","  '''\n","  Callback function to stop training at 100% accuracy\n","  '''\n","  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):\n","    if(logs['accuracy'] == 1.0 and logs['val_accuracy'] == 1.0):\n","      self.model.stop_training = True\n","\n","\n","def plot_accuracies(accuracies,Ns,Hs):\n","  '''\n","  Make a graph of mean % correct (and standard error) on the test set for the different values of H and N.\n","  Input: ndarray of |Hs|x|Ns|x(reps)\n","         actual values of Ns and Hs\n","  '''\n","  lenH,lenN,lenreps = accuracies.shape\n","  assert(lenH == len(Hs))\n","  assert(lenN == len(Ns))\n","  accuracies_mean = accuracies.mean(axis=2)\n","  accuracies_std = accuracies.std(axis=2)\n","  accuracies_stderr = accuracies_std/np.sqrt(lenreps)\n","  # plot\n","  fig = pyplot.figure()\n","  ax = fig.add_subplot(111)\n","  ax.axhline(0.5,linestyle=\"--\",color=\"gray\") # chance baseline\n","  centers = np.arange(lenN)\n","  for Hindex, H in enumerate(Hs):\n","    ax.bar(centers + 0.8/lenH*(Hindex-(lenH-1)/2),\n","           accuracies_mean[Hindex], 0.8/lenH, yerr=accuracies_stderr[Hindex],\n","           alpha=0.5, label=f\"{H} hidden units\")\n","  ax.set_xlabel(\"sequence length\")\n","  pyplot.xticks(centers,Ns)\n","  ax.set_ylabel(\"accuracy\")\n","  pyplot.legend(loc=\"lower left\")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"fyhd-HYBdcF0"},"source":["## Part 1\n","**Part 1.a**<br>\n","Fill in the code to create a net given H and N using the tanh activation function for the hidden units.
